This is not a "library"!

This is just a pile of code chunks. It is not like Steve Donovan's
PenLight.

It provides no guarantees for backward compatibility.

But has general idea: do not repeat code.

So there are many code chunks. They are relatively small and usually
has links to another, absolutely necessary, code chunks.

I'm using it as a resource base for my projects. I can automatically
extract chunks that are used by code and pack them in distrubution.
So in distrubution there are no dead code.

You are free legally use them under GPLv3.
