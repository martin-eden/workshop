Free software, as I see it.

This is open-source, free code. No obfuscation or any restrictions in
it's further use (except claiming your authorship on it's pieces).
From the other side to use it profitably you usually need qualification
near mine or higher. This is because I'm not doing simplifications
for things I personally not need. So there is no support for features
I dont personally wish.

Why so many tiny files?

Because I like it. I can supply tools using this code hive with
only really needed pieces from it. Id est if there is code piece
in supply - it is really used somewhere from code. No dead code.

Tools I supply uses copies of parts from this hive. So it will work
always, while standard lua works. Even if this library will be
deleted, tools will continue to work.

From the other hand, they inherit all bugs from original parent.
So from time to time I'm updating them, making copies from fresh
code hive version. Also there will be duplication of files,
when several tools installed, using similar code base. I dont
care it. I think it's filesystem task to maintain unique files.
