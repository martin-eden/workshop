/*
  Kinda murky interface written seven years ago in 2017.

  I've just discovered that design pattern and was wildly exploring it.
*/

Concept

  Indented string. Two length methods: one considers indent length,
  other doesn't.

Naming

  String is called "text". It really should not contain newlines.

  Indent plus "text" is called "line".

Interface

  init(indent: str)

    Set indent string. Empty text.

  is_empty()

    True if text is empty string.

  add(str)

    Add string to current text.

  get_line(): str

    Return indented string.

  get_line_length(): int

    Return length of line (in characters).

  get_text_length(): int

    Return length of text (in characters).
