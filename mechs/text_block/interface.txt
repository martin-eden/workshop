This is class for writing left-indented text.

Efforts are made for low memory consumption and ease of use.

It knows about indents, border spaces, line feeds, length of longest
line in indented block and length of longest line text in block.
Also it can concatenate with friendly text block.


General architecture

  Changeable text is last added line with non-empty text. It is
  accessed via <line_with_text> field. All previously lines added
  to <processed_text> object which have no methods to return it
  individually. (This is for low memory consumption as <processed_text>
  usually temporary disk file.)

  There two entry points for adding text: <add_curline> and
  <add_textline>. Let me show data layout for sample text

    [[
    do
      local a      <-- <processed_text>, {"do", \n, "  local a", \n}
      local b      <-- current entry point for add_textline()

                   <-- current entry point for add_curline()
    ]]

    <num_line_feeds>: 2
    <line_with_text>
      {indent: 1, text: "local b"}
    <indent_chunk>: "  "


  If the current line is not empty then <num_line_feeds> == 0
  and both <add_textline> and <add_curline> do the same.

  Usually you add text via <add_curline> unless you want to add
  something to the first non-empty line from bottom (say, add ";" to
  the "local b" from example above).


Border spaces

  Head and tail line spaces are internally trimmed. There no official
  way to make them appear in result text.


Supported operations

  Indents

    Indents are preserved between lines.

    inc_indent(),
    dec_indent() - increase/decrease indent for next line

    indent_chunk - string with block for building indents

      This is used at initialization (in init()), changing it
      after will have no effect.

    Mostly for internal use

      next_line_indent - stores indent (number) for next line


  Line feeds

    new_line() - move virtual cursor to new empty line

    request_clean_line() - if current line is not empty, starts new
      line

      So in end you may me sure that virtual cursor is on beginning
      of empty line.

    request_empty_line() - if previous line is not empty, starts
      new line and closes it.

      So in end it's guaranteed that previous line is empty (or
      absent in case current line is first). But no guarantees
      about emptiness of current line.

    on_clean_line() - returns true if current line is empty


  Adding text

    add_curline(s) - adds string <s> to current line

    add_to_prev(s) - adds string <s> to first non-empty line,
      counting back from bottom

      This strange function born to ease writing of node
      representers: inner representer may finish on empty line
      and it's parent caller may add text on it's last meaningful
      line.


  Getting text

    get_text() - returns string with all lines, indented and delimited
      with \n.


  Getting text metrics

    As this class was initially written to handle reformatting
    of code within given margins, it supplies function to get
    maximum width of our text.

    By the way, "width" has two flavors, length of line with
    indent and length of line without indent. First if obviously >=
    second, for given line. I name them "line length" and
    "line text length".

    get_text_width() - returns max("line text length") for existing text

    get_block_width() - returns max("line length") for existing text


  Other stuff

    There is function to add text from other instance of our class,

    include(other_instance, do_glue_border_lines) - adds text from
      other instance to us

      <do_glue_border_lines> - boolean parameter, when true first line
        of added block glued to last line, else it is added after
        last line.


All other methods not described here are probably implementation
details and may de changed/dropped any moment.
