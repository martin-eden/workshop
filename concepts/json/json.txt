Okay, what is JSON?

JSON means ((j)ava-(s)cript (s)erialized (o)object).

This is anonymous recursive <object> with possibly empty
comma-separated list of key-values. Terminal elements are
<null>, <number>, <boolean> and <string>. Key always is
<string>.

<object>
  List of key-values separated by ",". Key-value separated by ":".
  Key is <string>.

  "{" opt(list(<string> ":" <value>, ",")) "}"

<string>
  I'd say it's some text that starts and ends with """.
  Escape char is "\".  For character escaping details refer
  [load.via_parser.syntaxes.strict].

<number>
  Say it's almost natural representation of number with optional
  exponent part. No leading zeros if integer part > 0 ("01" is bad).
  Also no "+" sign in mantissa part. For details refer that [strics]
  syntax.

<boolean>
  Just words "true" or "false" (without quotes).

<null>
  Word "null", also without quotes.

<value>
  One of mentioned elements or <array>.

<array>
  List of <value>'s. Separated by ",".

  "[" opt(list(<value>, ",")) "]"

Now you know JSON.
