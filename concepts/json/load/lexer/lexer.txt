This is JSON lexer.

This module task is to export quick boolean functions

  is_null
  is_boolean,
  ...
  (see [syntels] sequence for full list)

for use in [parser] grammar.

Each function is called with parameters <s>, <s_pos> with parsing
string and start position in it. If function succeeds it returns
"true" and new start position.

Previous call results cached in <last_pos> and <last_token>.
As it is typical for grammar to iterate all possible tokens at
fixed positions.
