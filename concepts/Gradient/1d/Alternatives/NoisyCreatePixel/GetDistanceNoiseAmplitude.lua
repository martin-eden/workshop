  Distance-dependent noise amplitude function

  Maps value from [0.0, 1.0] to another value in [0.0, 1.0].

  That is the essence of "plasm" pattern: noise is dependent of distance
  between two points.

      In this "universe" maximum distance is 1.0. Not infinity.

      For human-pleasant results we _don't_ want linearity:

        For half-distance result ought to be larger or smaller
        than half-result for distance.

      Try wilder functions!
