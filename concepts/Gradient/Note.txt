No space-filling strategies here

There are dimensions of possibilities. I can think several types of them
just now. It means there is practical infinity.

I'm not going to make this place code tumor: adding fancy implementations
with their inevitable idiosyncratic interfaces.

You're on your own. We supply some predictable creation function,
with what and where call it is up to you.
