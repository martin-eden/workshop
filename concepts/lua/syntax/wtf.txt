Grammar elements for Lua language.

Named elements and common substructures are represented as
separate files.

For performance reasons this grammar is less restrictive than Lua's.
F.e. it allows invalid escape sequences ('\_') and assignments
to function call (f() = a). Task or code verification is already
well solved by "luac" tool.
