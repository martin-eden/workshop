TSV - (t)ab-(s)eparated (v)alues

This is probably the most simple format for storing list of
lists of values when values not contain delimiters.

\t - ASCII(9) - delimiter of values in list (no tail delimiter)
\n - some sort of newline -
  ASCII(10) ASCII(13) or
  ASCII(13) ASCII(10) or
  (ASCII(13) and not(ASCII(10)) or
  (ASCII(10) and not(ASCII(13)) -
  list delimiter. With possible tail delimiter.

  Generally tsv-file have one sort of newline delimiter in it.

So

<tsv>
  [ list(<sequence>, \n) [\n] ]

<sequence>
  [ list(<value>, \t) ]

<value>
  [ (not(\t, \n))^N ]

Now you know TSV.
