Verification (and validation) and parsing

  Verification checks data, making verdict.
  Validation changes data, making it valid.
  Parser converts data to new form.

  Parsers contract is produce data for further usage. Parsers MAY
  change given data. This decision is up to them, usually depends
  of what type of conversions they do. Parsers MUST accurately
  represent data at given level. Not on more general levels.
  Parsers may blow in work, so we need validators.

  Validator can't just look at blown parser stack trace and magically
  fix data. So we need verifiers to do diagnosis. Indeed it makes
  sense to call verifier before calling parser. As parsers are
  situation-unaware things and may hang or consume all memory in case
  of malformed data.

  Verifier implementation depend of parser. Verifier contract is
  that if data passed it without complains, parser WILL NOT fail for
  that data. Verifier MUST NOT change given data. This job is for
  validator. Verifier MUST produce diagnosis.

  Verifier checks data only on given level. It's typical that input of
  current verifier is result from previous parser. So if parser result
  assumed to be array of integers, verifier should rely on that.

  (We do not check that parser output is suitable for next verifier.
  This can be fixed by adding aposteriori verifier to concept.
  Aposteriori verifier will be handy in case of several parsers with
  same input and output format. I had no practical need in this yet.)

  In case of malformed data, verifier returns some results for
  validator or for caller (as and explanation why parsing was not
  done). (There can be different ways to implement this detail. In my
  initial implementation verifier returned table. Later I implemented
  it via coroutines: yield() bad cases for caller, which decides
  should he call verifier or just complain and terminate.)

  So validator does not need to do diagnosis, he just needs to know
  format of given table and be able to hammer-fix pointed errors.
  Validators MUST change given data some way, so that verifier WILL
  NOT complain for them again.

  Validators separated from verifiers as there can be different
  strategies to fix given input. As for given diagnosis there may
  be several treatments.
