Double-length version of MD4. This alorithm variation from RFC1186.
(Looks like Ronald Rivest likes to place two spaces after period.)

MD4 Message Digest Algorithm, RFC 1186, 1990-10



4.  Extensions

   If more than 128 bits of output are required, then the following
   procedure is recommended to obtain a 256-bit output.  (There is no
   provision made for obtaining more than 256 bits.)

   Two copies of MD4 are run in parallel over the input.  The first copy
   is standard as described above.  The second copy is modified as
   follows.

   The initial state of the second copy is:
                    word A:    00 11 22 33
                    word B:    44 55 66 77
                    word C:    88 99 aa bb
                    word D:    cc dd ee ff

   The magic constants in rounds 2 and 3 for the second copy of MD4 are
   changed from sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to cuberoot(2) and cuberoot(3):

                                    Octal           Hex
            Round 2 constant        012050505746    50a28be6
            Round 3 constant        013423350444    5c4dd124

   Finally, after every 16-word block is processed (including the last
   block), the values of the A registers in the two copies are
   exchanged.

   The final message digest is obtaining by appending the result of the
   second copy of MD4 to the end of the result of the first copy of MD4.
