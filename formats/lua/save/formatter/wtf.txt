Code to process structure returned by [preprocess] facility.

This structure is some sort of AST. We process it with handlers
dependent on type of AST node. Those handlers adds some text to
virtual printer/screen/terminal. At the end that text becomes
string with formatted source code.

There is notable method ":variate(node, oneliner, multiliner)" which
calls "oneliner" representation handler. If result is beyond margins
(or if we are inside of multiline block), it calls "multiliner"
handler. This allows adaptive formatting (at the cost of search
time).
