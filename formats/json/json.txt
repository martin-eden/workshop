Okay, what is JSON?

JSON means ((j)ava-(s)cript (s)erialized (o)object).

This is anonymous recursive <object> with possibly empty
comma-separated list of key-values. Terminal elements are
<null>, <number>, <boolean> and <string>. Key always is
<string>.

<object>
  "{" [ list(<string> ":" <value>, ",") ] "}"

<string>
  I'd say it's some text that starts and ends with ".
  For character escaping details you may see it's syntax in
  [load.via_parser.syntaxes.strict].

<number>
  Say it's almost natural representation of number with optional
  exponent part. It may not have leading zero if integer part > 0
  (so "01" is invalid). Also it may not have "+" sign in mantissa
  part. For details refer that [strics] syntax.

<boolean>
  Just words "true" or "false" (without quotes).

<null>
  Word "null", also without quotes.

<value>
  All mentioned elements or <array>.

<array>
  Anonymous list of <value>s. Comma-separated and possibly empty.

  "[" [ list(<value>, "," ] "]"

Now you know JSON.
