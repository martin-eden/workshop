Well, I've implemented JSON loader with traditional lexer-parser
scheme. This code is just boring and not too fast, 7.48s where
DkJson gives 4.47 (67% slower).

It was nor fun nor challenge to write it. But has done it as
  * need fast own parser
  * wished sample to profile and compare performance with
    parser-without-lexer.

Anyway I'm not going to write such sort of code further. This is
monkey job.
